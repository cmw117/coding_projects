	<h3>Javascript Basics</h3>
	<p>Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reason. It is asmall and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. Javascript lives inside a host environement (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
	<ul>
    <li><span class="starts">Variable Declaration</span> Javascript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable hols a value. All JavaScript variables must beindentified with unique names. These unique names are called indentifiers.<span class="purple"> var x;</span></li>
    <li><span class="starts">Variable Assignment </span>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="purple">var x=10</span></li>
    <li><span class="starts">Data types </span>Data types are an important concept' to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="purple">true </span>or <span class="purple">false; </span>null - <span class="purple">null </span>aka nothing; number <span class="purple">42 </span>or <span class="purple">3.1459;</span> string - <span class="purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="purple">[1, 'Coding', 1, 'Dojo']; </span>and object - <span class="purple">{first_name:'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
    <li> <span class="starts">Conditionals </span>When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocksbased on values or conditions that have been met. You can use continional statements in your code to accomplish this There the following conditional statements: <span class="purple">if </span> specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="purple">else </span>if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="purple">else </sopan>we execute this block of code;</li>
    <li><span class="starts">Loops </span>There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing; they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That is a loop!</li>
    <li> <span class="starts">Functions </span>are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as alist of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruciton manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
